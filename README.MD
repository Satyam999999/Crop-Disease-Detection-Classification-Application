End-to-End Crop Disease Detection & Classification Application

Tech Stack: Streamlit, TensorFlow, ResNet50, OpenCV, Python

• Built and deployed a full-stack crop disease detection system achieving 85.62% accuracy across 22 disease
classes from 1,700+ images.

• Compared 5 neural network architectures (ANN, CNN, VGG16, ResNet50), improving baseline accuracy from
38% to 85.62% via transfer learning and fine-tuning.

• Fine-tuned top 10 layers of ResNet50 and applied data augmentation, L2 regularization, and dropout to reduce
overfitting.
